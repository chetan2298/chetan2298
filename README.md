### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
### CSCI 630 Portfolio Journal. This profile is linked mainly with my academic work. 
 
### Highlights

1. Successfully refactored  issues with useNavigate tests that were failing (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/237)
2. Correctly mocked useNavigate Hook for Donors.test [feature](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/237)
3. Spearheaded team in adding New TestCases for Donor.tsx (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/182)
4. Wrote Placeholder Frontend tests by adding infrastructure to perform unit test cases for frontend codebase [test](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/166)
5. Consolidated the Coverage report for Frontend and Backend and created one job for both of them [report](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/244)
